      <h3>Which?</h3>
      <h4>Senior Developer</h4>
      <time datetime="2013-07-01">August 2013 to Present</time>
      <p>I was hired by Which as a front-end developer and was single-handedly responsible for the implementation of Google Analytics across the entire domain as well as a series of exciting UI pieces. A couple of months in, I was given the opportunity to train as a Ruby developer and have been completely absorbed in the culture and conventions ever since. I now act in both capacities on a daily basis and enjoy it thoroughly.</p>
      <p>My primary role at Which has been to develop new features for our flagship reviews product using Rails. This involves utilising Capybara, Cucumber, RSpec and Jasmine to write integration, behaviour and unit tests to drive the development of the code. A large part of this responsibility is managing and grooming product requirements, creating talks and technical demonstrations, and mentoring other developers.</p>
      <p>Recently we have started development of a new Rails application to replace the existing product. This meant re-designing the entire domain model; discussing and implementing code quality, acceptance testing, and auditing tools; and assisting in the hiring and screening of new Ruby developers.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h4>Why haven't you included your education history?!</h4>
    <p>We both know that my education history isn't relevant to anything you want to hire me for! I'm looking for a team that's interested in my contributions and knowledge. I'm more than happy to discuss my qualifications if you'd like to know! Just give me a call, any time.</p>

    <h4>Shouldn't this CV be a PDF or a DOC?!</h4>
    <p>I'm not a big fan of Word documents. I'd also love you to be able to view this on your mobile if you wish, and PDFs usually make that really awkward. If you would really like a PDF to keep for later, you can <a href="http://www.htmlpdf.com/" target="_blank">use this website to convert the page</a>. Sorted.</p>
