    <h3 class="summary__title">Summary</h3>
    <div class="summary__text">
      <p>Originally from Bath and now living in London, I've had a passion for programming since I was a small child. Having started my career in front-end development, I enjoy making beautiful and functional applications with CSS, HTML and JavaScript - and, more recently, I've fallen in love with Ruby too.</p>

      <p>I've worked for several startups in Bath and London to create great web experiences and received extremely positive feedback. More recently I worked for <i>Which?</i> to redesign and redevelop their entire website with a great team. I am also proud to say that I (almost) single-handedly implemented complex web analytics across their entire domain.</p>

      <p>My aim is to continue my journey to becoming a true polyglot by joining a talented team that help each other cultivate exceptional skills and technological knowledge. In my next role, I want to be technically challenged by varying and evolving full-stack requirements and share the satisfaction of implementing them artfully and effectively.</p>
